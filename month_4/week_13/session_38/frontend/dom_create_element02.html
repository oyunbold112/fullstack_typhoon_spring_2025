            <p>This chapter will discuss how to write a chapter.</p>
            <p>When writing, it's important to condense all ideas of the same kind into a chapter.</p>
            <p>The chapter acts as a parent to each paragraph.</p>
            <p>Because I have nothing left to say about chapters, this chapter is over.</p>
            <p>One more thing - <b>open the console</b> to see what's going behing the scenes!</p>
